Milestone Report: Exploratory Data Analysis
1. Introduction
This report summarizes the initial analysis of the text datasets provided by SwiftKey (blogs, news, and Twitter). The primary focus is to understand the data structure before building a next-word prediction model for the Shiny application.
2. Data Summaries
The first step involves loading the data and calculating basic statistics such as the number of lines and word counts.
Summary Table Example:
Source	Line Count	Word Count	File Size (MB)
Blogs	899,288	~37.5 Million	200+ MB
News	1,010,242	~34.7 Million	190+ MB
Twitter	2,360,148	~30.0 Million	160+ MB
3. Exploratory Analysis & Visualization
After cleaning the data (removing punctuation, numbers, and converting to lowercase), we can observe the word frequency distribution using histograms or word clouds.

    Interesting Findings: Common stop words such as "the", "to", and "and" dominate the dataset.
    Histogram: (This section will include n-gram frequency plots, such as the top 20 most frequent words).

4. Plans for Algorithm & Shiny Application
Future strategies include:

    N-gram Model: Utilizing Bigram and Trigram models to predict words based on previous context.
    Optimization: Due to the large dataset size, I will use sampling techniques (e.g., 1-5% of the data) to ensure the Shiny app remains lightweight and responsive.
    Shiny Application: The user interface will consist of a simple text input box that automatically displays next-word suggestions.
